# Roomies

Roomies is a game about having to share the same home while constantly at odds with one another. Redraw the lines of what constitutes your own home and exert your privilege to do what you want.

2 - 8 players using ASDW/Arrows on Keyboard or Xbox, Playstation, & Nintendo Switch controllers.

V1 was made in less than 48 hours by 5 people partaking in Global Game Jam 2019.

V2 was redesigned and reprogrammed following a brainstorm by the same 5 people and 6 months of development by programmer Ryan Bailey & designer Kevin Blum.
